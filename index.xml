      <description>Efficient Deep Learning Part 1 Link to heading Deep learning models have revolutionized many fields, from computer vision to natural language processing. However, they often come with a significant drawback: computational inefficiency. Large models require substantial computational resources, which can lead to high costs and slow inference times. In this series, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore various techniques to make deep learning models more efficient without significantly compromising performance.&#xA;Why Efficiency Matters Link to heading Resource Constraints: Not all environments have access to high-performance computing resources.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning Model Deployment Link to heading After successfully building your ML/DL model in a notebook, the next critical step is deploymentâ€”getting your model out into the world to serve customers. There are two primary avenues for deploying machine learning models:&#xA;Edge Deployment Cloud Deployment Edge Deployment Link to heading Edge deployment involves placing the model directly on the device where it will be used. This approach is particularly valuable in situations where:</description>
