# fn-2.5 Redesign navigation with hover states

## Description
TBD

## Acceptance
- [ ] TBD

## Done summary
## What Changed
- Redesigned navigation with comprehensive hover and focus states
- Reduced navigation link font size from theme's 1.7rem to 1rem for better proportion
- Added cyan accent color hover effect with subtle background change
- Implemented active page indicator with underline pseudo-element

## Why
- Navigation links were too large (1.7rem) creating visual imbalance
- Lacked clear hover states and accessibility focus indicators
- Needed consistent interaction design matching overall site aesthetic

## Verification
- Reviewed navigation styles against epic requirements
- Confirmed 1rem font size for navigation links
- Confirmed hover states with accent color (#22d3ee)
- Confirmed focus states with 2px outline for accessibility
- Confirmed 0.2s ease transitions
