# fn-1.2 Update About page with authentic content

## Description
Rewrite the About page (`/home/asad/dev/asad-ismail.github.io/content/about.md`) with authentic ML experience, skills, and background.

**Current issues:**
- Contains placeholder job info ("XYZ Company", "ABC Corporation")
- Generic placeholder content
- No real ML projects or experience described

**Content to include:**
1. Professional summary as a senior ML engineer
2. Work experience with real companies and roles
3. Technical skills (PyTorch, TensorFlow, MLOps, etc.)
4. Areas of expertise (computer vision, NLP, recommendation systems, etc.)
5. Education background
6. Current focus/interests

**Format:**
- Use YAML front matter (current file uses `---`)
- Keep the page structure simple and professional
- Write in first person
- Keep it concise (300-500 words)

**Reference:** `/home/asad/dev/asad-ismail.github.io/content/about.md:1-26`
