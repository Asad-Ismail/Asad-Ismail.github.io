## Professional Projects

### 1. Deep Learning-Based Phenotyping Pipeline
**Role:** Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Bayer (Aug 2020 – Present)  
**Description:** Led the development and deployment of an end-to-end deep learning-based phenotyping pipeline. The project involved data labeling, model training, deployment, and monitoring. The solution was successfully scaled across North America, Asia, and Europe, generating millions of phenotypes per month. The project included challenges like cell detection, classification, and deploying computer vision models on low-powered edge devices.  
**Achievements:** Received the Vegetable R&D 2021/2022 Top Performance Award.

### 2. Front Camera-Based Perception Stack for L2+ Autonomous Driving
**Role:** Technical Lead Deep Learning, ADAS at Visteon (Aug 2018 – July 2020)  
**Description:** Led a team to develop a front camera-based perception stack for L2+ autonomous driving. This included benchmarking the perception stack against state-of-the-art solutions like MobilEye EyeQ3 and Stradvision. The project also involved optimizing and evaluating the stack's performance on various SoCs (Nvidia, Qualcomm, TI).  
**Achievements:** Received the 2019 Future Maker Award.

### 3. CNN-Based Free Space and Object Detection
**Role:** Deep Learning Engineer, ADAS at Visteon (May 2018 – July 2018)  
**Description:** Developed a CNN-based approach for free space detection, object detection, and tracking. This project also involved planning and executing data collection and annotation initiatives in collaboration with internal and external suppliers.

### 4. CNN-Based Lane Detection Algorithm
**Role:** Computer Vision Engineer, ADAS at Visteon (May 2017 – April 2018)  
**Description:** Engineered a CNN-based algorithm for lane detection, including the calibration of both intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. The algorithm was implemented on Nvidia Drive PX 2 and tested in a vehicle environment.
