## This will be  about ML Model deployment

So we have built the ML/DL model in notebook and we want to deploy it to serve the customers there are two main sources of deployment

1. Edge Deployment
2. Cloud Deployment


### Edge Deployment
We want to deploy the models on device due to one of the following main reasons

1. Latency requiremnt
    Network latency is prohibitievly low sometime for real time deployment and control
2. No Network availablity
    Models are deployed where there is not internet available

Few examples 
Deploying perception model for advance driving assistant systems or Self driving cars
ML models deploymet on machine in distant fields with no internet conectivity and on spot results demand.

### Cloud deployment
