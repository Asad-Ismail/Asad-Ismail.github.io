# Projects

Welcome to my projects page! Here you'll find a selection of my work in machine learning, computer vision, MLOps, and deep learning systems.

## Featured Projects

### Computer Vision for Edge Devices

Deploying and optimizing computer vision models to run efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices. This work focuses on model compression, quantization, and optimization techniques that enable real-time inference on embedded systems.

**Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, OpenCV, Docker

**Applications**: Mobile devices, IoT sensors, embedded systems, edge computing

---

### End-to-End ML Pipelines

Building scalable, production-ready machine learning pipelines that handle data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. These pipelines are designed for reliability, reproducibility, and maintainability in production environments.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Kubeflow, MLflow, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP

**Focus areas**: Feature engineering, model versioning, experiment tracking, CI/CD for ML, monitoring and observability

---

### Large Language Model Applications

Developing applications and systems leveraging large language models for various NLP tasks including text generation, sentiment analysis, document understanding, and conversational AI.

**Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, vLLM, OpenAI API

**Use cases**: Document analysis, chatbots, content generation, semantic search, RAG systems

---

### Recommendation Systems

Building and deploying recommendation engines using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. Experience with both real-time and batch recommendation systems.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Spark, TensorFlow, Redis, PostgreSQL, Kafka

**Applications**: E-commerce, content platforms, personalized experiences
