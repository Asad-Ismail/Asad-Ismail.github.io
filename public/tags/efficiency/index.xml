      <description>Efficient Deep Learning Part 1 Link to heading Deep learning models have revolutionized many fields, from computer vision to natural language processing. However, they often come with a significant drawback: computational inefficiency. Large models require substantial computational resources, which can lead to high costs and slow inference times. In this series, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore various techniques to make deep learning models more efficient without significantly compromising performance.&#xA;Why Efficiency Matters Link to heading Resource Constraints: Not all environments have access to high-performance computing resources.</description>
